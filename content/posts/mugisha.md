I can understand the whole process of designing,creating and mantaining personalized content for a website.

I can define a CMS which is a software that can be used to modify and manage the creation of digital content.

I normally use wordpress and wix but excited to try hugo because of it deploys automation through github.

I can edit,write,outline,review,approve and publish content based on a specific workflow.

Through github and hugo integration,I can use the knowledge of how to deploy different technologies in content management.

Reading through instructions of installing technologies, I can use apply the self learning process of working with content management systems..
