I understand the whole process of design,create and mantain personalized content for a website.
CMS is a software that can be used to modify and manage the creation of digital content.
I normally use wordpress and wix but excited to try hugo because of it's quick automation through github.
I can edit,write,outline,review,approve and publish content based on which workflow.
Through github and hugo integration,I gained the knowledge of how to deploy different technologies in content management.
Reading through instructions of installing technologies gives you a self learning process of working with content management systems..
