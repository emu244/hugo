- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. Learning different concepts of multi channel distribution helped me understand content in relation to presentation.
- I can describe and compare content management systems. Learning about different multi channel distributions available to each CMS can help you compare content management systems.
- I can manage content using established workflows.Establishing content workflows for the final project helped better understand working with workflows.
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. Working with different multi channel distributions introduces one to different technologies such as distributing content on RSS feeds.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. Practicing publishing content on different channels such as on twitter can help in self-directed learning in publishing content.
