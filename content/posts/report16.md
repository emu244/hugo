- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. Learning different multi channel distributions and understanding content beyond web centricity helps understand different concepts of content management. 
- I can describe and compare content management systems. Sometimes it is important to publish content on different channels and one can use this feature to compare CMS.
- I can manage content using established workflows.Continued working with the group's workflow for the end of the semester assignment helps in becoming better at using workflows.
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. Getting introduced to technologies such as feedbin and Rss introduces one to new technologies.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. Practing publishing posts from this class on different channels can help in self directed learning.
